# Edurata workflows

This repository contains workflows that are maintained by the edurata team. Have fun with them!

## Structure

- `examples`: Contains example workflows that can be used as a starting point for your own workflows.
- `internals`: Contains workflows that are used internally by the edurata platform but are open source for transparency. For example for the build functions workflow.
- `apps`: Contains workflows that are used for applications managed by edurata running on the edurata platform. They can be used as a reference for your own applications.

More info on how to configure Workflows in the [Documentation](https://docs.edurata.com/#workflow-config)

## Examples that are live

The apps in `invoice-forwarder` and `short-story-bot` are live and can be used as a reference for your own apps.
