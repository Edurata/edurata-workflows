title: Testing all runtimes with a hello-world function.
description: |
  Automates the testing of basic functionality across multiple runtimes by executing a hello-world print statement. It constructs a message from input messages, processes it using Python, Node.js, and Docker-based environments, and ensures compatibility through inline and repository-based function execution. It also includes a conditional foreach loop to iterate selectively over input messages.
interface:
  inputs:
    properties:
      messages:
        type: array
        items:

outputs:
  messageFromDocker: ${test-docker-upstream.message}
  messageFromPython: ${test-python.message}
  messageFromNode: ${test-node.message}

  test-foreach-with-if:
    description: |
