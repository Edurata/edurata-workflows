name: auto-workflow-generate-blogs
apiRevision: edurata.io/workflow/v1
description: The process retrieves the latest unprocessed post from an Airtable table and downloads a Git repository based on the post's workflow path. It then obtains the workflow definition from the downloaded repository. The system generates blog content about the workflow using a specific model and API key. If successful, it marks the record as processed in the Airtable workflow table. Lastly, it updates a blog post in an Airtable database with the generated content and sets its 'freeToPublish' field to False.
